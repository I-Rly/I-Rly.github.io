        <p>The following is a brief overview of projects I have worked on over the years.</p>

        <h2>Recovery of data from second-hand hard-drives</h2>
        <h3>Undergraduate second year project</h3>
        <p> A study into what data can be recovered from hard-drives purchased on the second-hand market.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>"Hasher"</h2>
        <h3>Post graduate programming project</h3>
        <p>"Hasher" is a simple Python commandline tool for calculating the MD5 and SHA1 hashes of files. "Hasher" is able to detect protential MD5 and/or SHA1 hash collsions (where two files have the same MD5 or SHA1 hash) and report them as such. It is able to compare two files or one file against a folder. The program produces seperate timestamped TXT files for logging and results reporting.</p>
